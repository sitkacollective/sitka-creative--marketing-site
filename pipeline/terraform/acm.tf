#** This certificate needs to be created manually in the AWS Console so that it is available for use by Terraform.                                          #
#** Wanted to avoid having the certificate managed by Terraform because we want to avoid creating/destroying the same certificate over and over again.      #
#** MAKE SURE YOU CREATE IT IN `us-east-1`                                                                                                                  #
